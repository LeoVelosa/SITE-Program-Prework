Reflection Questions
If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. [I did not use any outside resources.]

What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [The challenge I came to was finding the time
to work on this submission on top of my school work. I am taking a heavy workload this semester on top of working 40 hours a week.
I found just enough time to work on this, however I really did want to continue working on it and
add some of the optional features. In terms of actual technicalities I didn't really run into any
problems. I understood pretty much everything even though this is my first time using javascript.]

What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [My main questions are in terms of data.
I am not really sure how servers and updating data works on websites. How does the html get updated
in real time? Also what other platforms there are to create web applications? Are there any free
platforms that you can host servers on? How do you get your website to be on the internet?]

If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [
First off, I would complete the optional features as I believe that would be great to improve and
learn more about web development. Second I would try to make the website prettier and just improve
the general quality. I would also maybe try to think of a different mode you can play with the same
general concept, like maybe mode where you dont see the flash of the pattern, it just plays the
sound and you have to learn the sounds to replicate the pattern.]
